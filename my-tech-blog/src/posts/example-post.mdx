# Getting Started with React and Markdown Blogs

Welcome to your first blog post! This post demonstrates the capabilities of your new React-powered blog, which uses Markdown for content creation.

## Why React + Markdown?

Building a blog with React and Markdown offers several advantages:

1. **Speed**: Static content loads quickly
2. **Simplicity**: No database required
3. **Developer-friendly**: Write posts in Markdown
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to customize and extend

## Code Examples

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function BlogCard({ post }) {
  return (
    <div className="blog-card">
      <h2>{post.title}</h2>
      <p className="date">{post.date}</p>
      <p>{post.excerpt}</p>
      <Link to={`/post/${post.slug}`}>Read more</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Adding Images

You can include images stored in your assets folder:

![React Logo](/assets/react-logo.png)

Or from external sources:

## Styling and Formatting

Markdown supports **bold text**, *italic text*, and even:

> Blockquotes for important information or testimonials.

You can also create tables:

| Feature    | Supported |
